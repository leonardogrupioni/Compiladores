# 🛠️ Minerva Compiler — PUC‑SP Compiler Design Project

**Minerva** is a strongly‑typed, procedural, Portuguese‑friendly programming language inspired by pseudocode, Python, C# and Pascal.  
The complete compiler was written in **Java** as the final assignment for the Compiler Design course at PUC‑SP. All source code, grammar, reference manual and the final academic report are available in this repository.

## ✨ Language highlights

| Feature                | Description                                                                                                   |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Friendly syntax**    | Keywords in Portuguese to help beginners grasp programming concepts quickly.                                  |
| **Static typing**      | Four basic types: `int`, `dec`, `carac`, `bool`.                                                              |
| **Structured control** | Procedures & functions, `se / senao`, `enquanto`, `repita … até que`, `para … passo …`.                      |
| **String support**     | Built‑in `carac[]` type for character arrays.                                                                 |
| **Educational focus**  | Designed to be as close as possible to textbook pseudocode while still compiling to executable code.          |

## 🏗️ Compiler architecture

The compiler follows the classic multi‑phase model:

1. **Lexical analysis** – token stream generated by `Lexica.java`, using a custom hash‑table for reserved words.  
2. **Syntax analysis** – recursive‑descent parser implemented in `Sintatica.java`, producing an abstract syntax tree (`Arvore` class).  
3. **(Future work)** Semantic analysis & code generation (prototype for WebAssembly planned).

Detailed diagrams and discussions are available in the final report.

## 🚀 Getting started

### Prerequisites
* **JDK 17** or later  
* Optional: **BlueJ** (original IDE) or any modern IDE (IntelliJ / VS Code)

### Compile & run

```bash
# Compile all sources
javac *.java

# Run the compiler (expects a Minerva source file, e.g. hello.mi)
java main hello.mi
```

The compiler outputs an intermediate representation (`.algo`) which can be interpreted by the simple runtime written for the course.

## 🧪 Testing

Example programs are included in `teste.txt` and in the report appendix. They demonstrate:

* The obligatory `principal` procedure  
* Variable declarations & assignments  
* Control‑flow statements  
* Function / procedure calls  
* Character arrays and string I/O
